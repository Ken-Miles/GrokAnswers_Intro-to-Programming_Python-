Grok: Intro to Programming (Python) (Answers)

Hello student in desparation, do not worry about your Grok homework anymore, as I have the answers. Each module has it's own folder, and within each folder is the code for each assignment, along with it's name. Pretty self explainory. Please let me know if any of the code doesn't work or has problems.

Just make sure to read and make sure you agree to the license.

(This is a WIP and I don't have all the answers in yet, so far I have up to M6A4 as of 11/9)


ANYBODY ADDING CODE PLEASE READ BELOW:



I have a distinct naming system for referencing answers for each question and prompt. Each file format will look something like this:
M[x]A[y]: N"[z]"

M stands for module, and for x you put the module number (without the brackets)

A stands for assignment, which is the assignment number for each module. In my experience each module has 4 assignments, assignment 1 being 1, assignment 2 being 2, etc.

N stands for name, you put the name of the assignment there when adding more code. This is the name provided when hovering over the assignment, to again make it a bit easier to find. 


Please please please make sure to add new assignments to their respective folders as well.

NOTE FOR ALL:

NOTE FOR M4A4
The assignment name is a "/" and not a "\", but Github thinks the name is a filepath when named with a forward slash, so I had to name it with a backward slash instead. This is not a mistake.
